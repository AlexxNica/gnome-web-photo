Improvements:
* Improve thumbnail creation time
* Thumbnailing service? I.e. background process (which exits after some time without requests),
  which the frontend tells which files/pages to thumbnail.
* Fix the output on framed pages
* Add memory size and CPU time limit (look at totem-video-thumbnailer/indexer)
* Implement printing to printer, using the gtk 2.10 print APIs
