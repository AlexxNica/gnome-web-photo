Issues after webkit port:
* PHOTO_MODE doesn't work for very tall pages (like pgo, see comment before
  gtk_widget_set_size_request()). We can possibly use a GtkScrolledWindow to
  make this work.

Webkit issues:
* Using the custom CSS for iframes doesn't actually work perfectly: it seems to
  append lots of empty space at the end.

Improvements:
* Improve thumbnail creation time
* Thumbnailing service? I.e. background process (which exits after some time without requests),
  which the frontend tells which files/pages to thumbnail.
* Fix the output on framed pages
* Add memory size and CPU time limit (look at totem-video-thumbnailer/indexer)
