In order to keep the code nice and clean we have a few requirements you'll
need to stick to in order to get your patch accepted:

- all files have to be encoded in UTF-8

  Comment blocks are written like this:
  
/*
 * bla_bla_cb: This is an example comment block
 */

When submitting a patch or committing to cvs do not forget
to write a Changelog entry. Please put both a description
and a reference to the bug (if there is one). Write your entry
using UTF-8 encoding, and make sure your editor doesn't mangle
the encoding of the ChangeLog file.


Example of an entry:
